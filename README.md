# Music Recommender System 



## Overview

This project implements a music recommender system  using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It recommends music based on the content similarity of video descriptions.


## Introduction

This repository contains a Python-based music recommender system that leverages NLP techniques to recommend music based on their textual content.

## Data Collection

The dataset used for this project can be found at (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/notsh...). 

## Text Preprocessing

Before feeding the descriptions into the recommender system, text preprocessing steps are applied:

- Clean and normalize text by removing special characters, punctuation, and converting all letters to lowercase.
- Tokenize the descriptions into individual words or phrases.
- Remove stopwords (common words like "and," "the," "is," etc.) that do not contribute significantly to the meaning of the text.

## Feature Extraction

To enable machine learning model training, text data is transformed into numerical representations:

- Techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) are used for feature extraction.
- These numerical features capture the essence of the text and allow for similarity calculations.

## Building a Recommender Model

Several recommendation algorithms can be applied, with content-based filtering being a suitable choice for this project:

- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends music based on the similarity of video descriptions. It calculates similarity scores between videos using their preprocessed descriptions and feature representations.
  
## Usage

To use the music recommender system:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Priyanka-2468/Music_Recommendation_System.git
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Prepare your dataset and run the recommender system according to the provided scripts and instructions.
